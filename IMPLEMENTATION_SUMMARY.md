# Auth0 Authentication Implementation Summary

This document outlines the changes made to implement Auth0 as the primary authentication method for the FindShuttles admin portal, replacing Netlify Identity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Auth0 Integration
- Added Auth0 configuration in `src/lib/auth0-config.js`
- Created API routes for Auth0:
  - Login: `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
  - Callback: `src/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`
  - Logout: `src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
- Added Auth0 login button component in `src/components/Auth0LoginButton.tsx`

### 2. Middleware Modifications
- Updated middleware in `src/middleware.ts` to:
  - Remove Netlify Identity authentication check
  - Prioritize Auth0 authentication
  - Keep fallback authentication methods (system auth and NextAuth)
  - Update the authentication check strategy order

### 3. Login Page Redesign
- Simplified the login page to remove the Netlify Identity option
- Set Auth0 as the default login method
- Kept legacy NextAuth authentication as a fallback option
- Improved UI to make the primary authentication method clearer

### 4. Netlify Configuration
- Updated `netlify.toml` to remove Netlify Identity specific settings
- Added Auth0 API endpoint redirection in Netlify configuration
- Removed Netlify Identity token handling redirects

### 5. Package Dependencies
- Added Auth0 SDK dependency: `@auth0/nextjs-auth0`
- Added `postinstall` script to ensure Prisma client generation

## Authentication Flow

The new authentication flow follows this order:
1. **Auth0 (Primary)**: Redirects to Auth0 Universal Login page, handles callback with role assignment
2. **System Auth (Backup)**: Server-side token-based authentication for reliable access
3. **Direct Auth (Emergency)**: Emergency access token for troubleshooting
4. **NextAuth (Legacy)**: Previous authentication system kept for backward compatibility

## Required Environment Variables

For Auth0 to work, the following environment variables must be set in the Netlify dashboard:

```
AUTH0_SECRET=<generated-secret>
AUTH0_BASE_URL=https://findshuttles.netlify.app
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=<your-auth0-tenant-url>
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<from-auth0-dashboard>
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<from-auth0-dashboard>
AUTH0_SCOPE=openid profile email
```

## Setup Instructions

Please follow the detailed instructions in `AUTH0_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to:
1. Create an Auth0 account and tenant
2. Register a new application
3. Configure callback URLs
4. Set up environment variables

## Migration Path

This implementation allows for a gradual migration from Netlify Identity to Auth0:
1. Auth0 is now the primary authentication method
2. Netlify Identity has been completely removed
3. NextAuth remains as a fallback for existing users

The login page clearly recommends using Auth0 and only presents the legacy option as an alternative.
