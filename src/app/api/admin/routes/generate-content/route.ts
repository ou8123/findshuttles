ðŸ”¹ seoDescription Writing Instructions:
Paragraph 1 â€“ Transport Summary
Briefly describe the shuttle service as a practical option for travelers needing reliable point-to-point transport. Mention the partnership with local providers in natural, varied language (e.g., "we work with local operators," "through partnerships with regional transport companies," etc.). Focus on the efficiency and simplicity of getting from one place to another.
Avoid:
- Vehicle descriptions
- Driver mentions
- Sensational or promotional language
- Any suggestion this is a daily commuter service

Paragraph 2 â€“ Destination Overview
Include one short reference to visiting or spending time in the destination. Use varied phrasing (e.g., "If you're spending time in ${destinationCityName}â€¦" or "For those planning a stay in ${destinationCityName}â€¦").
Mention 1â€“2 key attractions or areas of interest, such as parks, beaches, or local highlightsâ€”written in a clean, matter-of-fact tone.
End with a simple sentence noting that the shuttle offers easy access to the destination.

âœ… Style Guidelines:
- Tone: Neutral, professional, and concise
- Audience: Travelers using intercity or airport shuttle services
- Avoid: Promotional wording, emotional or exaggerated language
- Do not mention vehicles or drivers
- Keep everything focused, factual, and practical`;
